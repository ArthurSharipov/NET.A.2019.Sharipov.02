# Day-2
Tasks:
1. Given two integer signed four byte numbers and two bit positions i and j
(i & lt; j). Implement + InsertNumber algorithm for inserting bits from j-th to i-th bit
one number to another so that the bits of the second number occupy positions with bit j
by bit i (bits are numbered from right to left).
2. Implement the FindNextBiggerNumber method, which accepts
a positive integer and returns the nearest largest integer,
consisting of digits of the original number, and - 1 (null), if there is no such number
exists.
3. Implement the FilterDigit method, which takes a list of integers and
filters the list so that only numbers remain on the output,
containing the given digit. LINQ not to use! For example, for a digit
7, FilterDigit (7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,68,69,70,15,17) - & gt; {7, 70, 17}.
4. Implement the FindNthRoot algorithm to calculate the root of the nth
degrees (n∈N) from the number (a∈R) by Newton’s method with a given accuracy.
